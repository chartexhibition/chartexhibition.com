Good researchers put a lot of effort into making their work beautiful, in particular, the tricky task of visualising their findings in charts and graphs. We think they should get a chance show off their great work to a wider audience. That's why we've started Chart Exhibition.

Our first exhibition is being organised for late 2017 in Brisbane, Australia.

We are looking for high quality charts from three categories:
 * Published charts
 * Local chartists
 * Pop-chart

We are currently working on a submissions system, in the mean time, send them in to <submissions@chartexhibition.com>

If you'd like to sponsor us or say hi, drop us an email here <enquiries@chartexhibition.com>
