Firstly, welcome & thanks for visiting our site =]

Without a doubt, the chart exhibition team loves a clear graph. Some can be a bit rough though. Take this one from [the Australian Innovation System report](https://industry.gov.au/Office-of-the-Chief-Economist/Publications/Documents/Australian-Innovation-System/2016-AIS-Report.pdf) that show's Australia's dismal performance in the OECD rankings for research and industry collaboration.

Ugh.

For those of us lucky (and patient) enough to straddle both industry and research, it's no question that both sides have a lot to give to and get from each other. But clearly, not enough is being done.

So our questions are simple: why are we low on this list? and how can we get higher?

We doubt there are simple answers to those questions, but let's try to make and a dent.

Let's show off some top notch research, learn about how it's used, and learn what it needs to take it to the next level.

Let's encourage and celebrate researchers taking time making their work accessible outside academic circles.

Let's run it like an art exhibition, open to the public, in a neutral venue, to engage and inform a wider audience about the research and the broader questions about collaboration.

Let's have an opening night with a bar tab (okay, not so critical for the bigger picture, but we've gotta have some fun along the way)

Let's host Chart Exhibition.

Stay tuned.
